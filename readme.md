Project Overview:

Title: Library Management System with User Authentication

Objective: To develop a comprehensive Library Management System that allows users to borrow, return. The system also includes user authentication to manage access and roles effectively.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication:

	-Registration and Login: Users can register and log in to the system with a username and password.
	-Role-Based Access: The system supports different roles (e.g., students and librarians) to manage access to 	 	 	 various functionalities.
2. Library Operations:

	-Display Available Books: List all available books in the library.

	-Borrow Books: Users can borrow books, and the system tracks borrowed books along with due dates.
	-Return Books: Users can return borrowed books, making them available for others.
	-Donate Books: Users can donate new books to the library along with PDF files.
	-Track Books: The system tracks which books are borrowed and by whom.

	Technical Details:

Classes and Their Responsibilities:


1. User Class:

	-Manages user details, including username, hashed password, and role.

2. LibrarySystem Class:

	-Manages overall system operations, including user registration, login, and logout.
	-Interfaces with the Library class to manage library-specific operations.

3. Library Class:

	-Manages the collection of books, including their availability and PDF paths.
	-Handles book borrowing, returning, and donating operations.
	-Tracks borrowed books and checks for overdue books.

4. Student Class:

	-Provides methods for students to request, return, and donate books.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example Workflow:

1. User Registration and Login:

	-A user registers with a username, password, and role (e.g., student).
	-The user logs in with their credentials.

2. Borrowing a Book:

	-The user selects the option to borrow a book.
	-The system checks the availability of the book.
	-If available, the system provides a link to download the bookâ€™s PDF and updates the borrowed books list.

3. Returning a Book:

	-The user selects the option to return a book.
	-The system updates the book's status to available and removes it from the borrowed books list.

Conclusion:

The Library Management System project demonstrates effective use of object-oriented programming principles, user authentication, and file handling to create a functional and user-friendly library system. It addresses ensuring secure and role-based access to various features. This project showcases practical skills in Python programming, data management, and system design, making it a valuable addition to any software development portfolio.
